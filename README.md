# Amazon-Books-Review-sklearn-
A real world python machine learning project using the sci-kit learn library. In this I worked my way to building a model that automatically classifies text as either having a positive or negative sentiment. I did this by using amazon reviews as our training data. 

Data directory contains several files of 1000+ amazon reviews across different departments.<br/>
